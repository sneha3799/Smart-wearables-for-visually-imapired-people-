# Smart-wearables-for-visually-imapired-people

We created smart shoes for visually impaired people along with two android apps.
The android application can send location in case of emergencies and it is paired with smart voice assistant provided by google for visually impaired people.
The shoes vibrate when an obstacle is detected in front of person and servo motor rotates to check the direction in which person can move.
One cap in which a camera is there can be used to detect around 80 objects using pretrained YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model trained on Microsoft COCO Dataset.

Future scope -

Pothole detection
