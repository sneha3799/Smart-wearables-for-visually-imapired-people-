# Smart-wearables-for-visually-imapired-people

We created smart shoes for visually impaired people along with two android apps.
The android applications can send location in case of emergencies and it is paired with smart voice assistant provided by google for visually impaired people and can save the locations where person regularly visits.
The shoes vibrate when an obstacle is detected in front of person 
Future scope -
